		"""Callback that is called before training begins.

		# Arguments
			env: (`Env` instance): Environment that the agent interacts with. See [Env](#env) for details.
			nb_episodes (integer): Number of episodes to perform.
			action_repetition (integer): Number of times the agent repeats the same action without
				observing the environment again. Setting this to a value > 1 can be useful
				if a single action only has a very small effect on the environment.
			callbacks (list of `keras.callbacks.Callback` or `rl.callbacks.Callback` instances):
				List of callbacks to apply during training. See [callbacks](/callbacks) for details.
			verbose (integer): 0 for no logging, 1 for interval logging (compare `log_interval`), 2 for episode logging
			visualize (boolean): If `True`, the environment is visualized during training. However,
				this is likely going to slow down training significantly and is thus intended to be
				a debugging instrument.
			nb_max_start_steps (integer): Number of maximum steps that the agent performs at the beginning
				of each episode using `start_step_policy`. Notice that this is an upper limit since
				the exact number of steps to be performed is sampled uniformly from [0, max_start_steps]
				at the beginning of each episode.
			start_step_policy (`lambda observation: action`): The policy
				to follow if `nb_max_start_steps` > 0. If set to `None`, a random action is performed.
			log_interval (integer): If `verbose` = 1, the number of steps that are considered to be an interval.
			nb_max_episode_steps (integer): Number of steps per episode that the agent performs before
				automatically resetting the environment. Set to `None` if each episode should run
				(potentially indefinitely) until the environment signals a terminal state.

		# Returns
			A `keras.callbacks.History` instance that recorded the entire training process.
